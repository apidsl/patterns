> ## Overview
> 
> Algorithm
> 
> Given a problem, an algorithm A\\mathcal{A}A is a set of well-defined instructions that runs in a finite amount of time and space. It receives an input III and returns an output OOO that satisfies the constraints of the problem.

> As an example, a problem can be to check whether a number is even. In order to do that, an algorithm could be to check whether the number is divisible by 2.
> 
> ### Iteration
> 
> An iterative algorithm is an algorithm that runs through a sequence of actions. It is characterized by either a for or a while loop.

> Suppose we want to return the sum of all of the elements of a given list. An example of an iterative algorithm would be to sequentially add each element of the list to a variable, and return its final value.
> 
> ### Recursion
> 
> A recursive algorithm uses a function that calls itself. It is composed of the following components:
> 
> -   _Base case:_ This is the set of inputs for which the outputs are known.
> -   _Recursive formula:_ The answer of the current step is based on function calls relying on previous steps, eventually using the base case answer.
